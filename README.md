# Python-Course

A course created by me to teach my peers in the Vancouver Kaggle community about Python and Data Science. These are long and comprehensive notebooks about packages in Python and how to use them. Majority of the information is from the package documentation. The difference here is that I  wrap a small story behind it to make it more digestible. The notebooks only cover the most 80% of the package content. For the remaining 20%, please consult the documentation.
